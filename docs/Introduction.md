# Introduction

### **IML** stands for Intel Manager for Lustre
### **IML** is responsible for the installation, configuration, monitoring, and overall management of [Lustre](http://lustre.org/).

Before accessing our source code repository for the first time, new contributors should have a good understanding of the tools and processes in place.
* Become very familiar with [git](Git_Info.md)
* Become familiar with the [IML codebase](https://github.com/intel-hpdd)
* Learn the IML [contributor workflow](Contributor_Workflow.md)
* Be ready to learn new things

## Frontend Code and Backend Code
IML consists of a **Frontend GUI** that is written primarily in **Node JS** and server-side **Backend** code that is written primarily in **python**. The codebase relies on many external dependencies and uses many services and APIs.
